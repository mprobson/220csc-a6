# A6. Convolution

Due Date: 11/25 at midnight (optional)

## Instructions

Implement two versions of the one-dimensional (1D) convolution kernel.
Use 0's for boundary/missing values/elements.

1. Naive implementation (10.2 slide 10)
2. Utilize constant cache memory for mask (10.2 slides 22 - 26)

Compare the performance of these two approaches.

## Reflection Questions

1. When does it make sense to use constant memory?
2. What went well with this assignment?
3. What was difficult?
4. How would you approach differently?
5. Anything else you want me to know?
