# A6. Convolution

Due Date: 11/25 at midnight (optional)

## Instructions

Implement two versions of the one-dimensional (1D) convolution kernel.
Use 0's for boundary/missing values/elements.

1. Naive implementation (10.2 slide 10)
2. Utilize constant cache memory for mask (10.2 slides 22 - 26)

Compare the performance of these two approaches.
